# NodeLearning
This is just an application of my what I did while learning NodeJS.
This respository shows how to work with Express, Views, Mongoose, MongoDB, e.t.c. This just a sandbox to show how I can do CRUD operations from the backend.
It also show how the files can be arranged for easy accessibility and understandable to other developers.
