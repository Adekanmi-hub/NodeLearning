# NodeLearning
This is just an application of my what I did while learning NodeJS.
This respository shows how to work with Express, Views, Mongoose, MongoDB, e.t.c.
This is a sandbox to show how I did CRUD(Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations from the backend.
It also show how the files can be arranged for easy accessibility and understanding to other developers.
Files were broken into MVC(Models, views and Controllers). There is also a separate file for the routes.

More improvement to come as I learn and work on things have leant :)
